You are an expert B2B sales and marketing strategist. You will be provided a csv consisting of all contacts from LinkedIn. Based on the following Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and the below mentioned scoring function sort these companies based on the score.

## Sorting methodology
Sort the companies based on a score that you will compute to assign each company.

## Scoring function

Scoring factors for the company:
* Does the company have a wet lab facility themselves. This should be a physical address,
not a virtual lab. Yes - 20, No - 1
* Does this company uses cell culture as their core value proposition. That’s what they do day and
night. Yes 20, No 1
* The company has a minimum 10 employees and a maximum 30 employees Yes 20, No 1
* The company has raised more than $3M in venture funding Yes 20, No 1
* The company has raised money in the last 6 months Score Yes 20, No 1
* The company is actively hiring new wet lab scientists or AI/ML engineers. Score Yes 20, No 1

Now compute an average of these scores. Sort the companies based on the computed average. 
Create a detailed csv with the raw scores and all the company details by adding new columns to the supplied csv.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Summary
Elnora is a techbio startup offering an AI co-pilot that helps scientists design and scale cell culture protocols.  
Ideal customers are fast-moving, well-funded biotech startups and pre-clinical CROs where cell culture is the operational bottleneck.  
Focus: Series A/B biotechs (10–50 employees) and CROs with $5M+ ARR that run their own wet labs.  
Decision-making: Able to commit ~$100K+ pilots within 1–2 months. Prioritize speed, efficiency, reproducibility.

### Account Profile (Company-Level)

**Biotechs**
- Internal R&D teams with custom assay pipelines
- VC backed  
- Funding: Ideal $10M+ raised; Minimum $3M+ if cell culture heavy  
- Stage: Series A/B (sometimes late Seed)  
- Employees: 10–50  
- Core Technology (must be cell-culture dependent):  
  - Cell & gene therapy, biologics, organoid/3D culture, protein manufacturing, novel therapeutic screening, regenerative medicine  
  - Using cancer cell lines, iPSCs, primary cells, organoids  
- Lab Requirements: MUST have wet lab space; focus on novel therapeutics  
- Geography: US hubs + UK/EU (US preferred) → Bay Area, Boston, NYC, Austin, San Diego, RTP  
- Qualifying signals: Funding <6 months, hiring lab scientists/automation engineers, IND-enabling studies, big pharma partnerships, lab expansions

**Pre-clinical CROs/CDMOs**
- Revenue: $5M+ ARR  
- Employees: 30–100  
- Focus: Pre-clinical biology services only (cell-based assays, in vitro tox, disease models, biologics testing, antibody discovery, target validation)  
- Exclusions: No chemistry services, no clinical trials  
- Geography: Same as above  
- Qualifying signals: Service expansion, new client wins, hiring cell culture scientists, new facilities, automation/high-throughput, press on scaling

**Also relevant**  
- Life science vendors (media, reagents, cell lines)  
- Techbio startups (Series A–C, scaling fast)

### Disqualifiers
- Chemistry-only companies  
- Clinical CROs (Phase I–III trials)  
- Virtual biotechs without wet labs  
- <10 employees or >200 employees  
- Academic/university labs  
- Bacterial/yeast-only cultures  
- Diagnostics without cell culture  
- Recent layoffs/restructuring  
- M&A/acquisition in progress  

---

### Triggers
- Funding raised <3 months → growth mandate  
- Hiring multiple cell culture roles → scaling urgency  
- New pharma partnership → delivery pressure  
- New CSO/CBO/VP R&D hired → open to vendors  
- Lab expansion → setting up processes  
- Public mentions of protocol/automation challenges  
- Speaking at conferences  
- New service line launch (CROs)  
- Entered new therapeutic area  
- Achieved regulatory milestone

### Task
Using this ICP, generate:
1. Clear qualification checklist  
2. Messaging themes for outreach (value props, pain points, urgency triggers)  
3. Targeting strategy (who to prioritize, where to look for signals)  
4. Example outbound sequences (email, LinkedIn, conference intro)  
5. Risks to watch out for in prospecting
